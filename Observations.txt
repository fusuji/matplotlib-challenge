Three Observations and Insights about the Data

1) Ceftamin has the more extreme potential outliers, according to the box plot 
created, when calculating for tumor_volume in mice for the particular drug. 

2) Based on the data from mouse l509, tumor volume ultimately decreases as time 
goes by for mice particpating in the Capomulin treatment.

3) According to the data provided for capomulin regimen, there is a positive 
correlation between the weight of the mouse and the average tumor volume contained
in the mouse.
